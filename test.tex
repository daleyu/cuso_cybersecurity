\begin{questions}
\question
A contractor is required by a county planning department to submit one, two, three, four, or five forms (depending on the nature of the project) in applying for a building permit. Let $Y=$ the number of forms required of the next applicant. The probability that $y$ forms are required is known to be proportional to $y$---that is, $p(y)=ky\ \text{for}\ y=1,\dots,5.$

\begin{parts}
\part[2] What is the value of $k$? (\textit{Hint}: $\sum_{y=1}^5p(y)=1$)
\part[2] What is the probability that at most three forms are required?
\part[2] What is the probability that between two and four forms (inclusive)are required?
\part[2] Could $p(y)=y^2/50\ \text{for}\ y=1,\dots,5$ be the \textit{pmf} of $Y$. 
\end{parts}

\question
The \textit{pmf} of the amount of memory \textit{X} (GB) in a purchased flash drive was given as
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c} 
 $x$ & 1 & 2 & 4 & 8 & 16 \\
 \hline
 $p(x)$ & 0.05 & 0.10 & 0.35 & 0.40 & 0.10\\  
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Compute the following:
\begin{parts}
\part[2] Expected value $E(X)$
\part[2] Variance $V(X)$ directly from the definition
\part[2] The standard deviation $\sigma(X)$
\part[2] $V(X)$ using the shortcut formula ($V(X)=E(X^2)-E^2(X)$)
\end{parts}

\question Each of 12 refrigerators of a certain type has been returned to a distributor because of the presence of a high-pitched oscillating noise when the refrigerator is running. Suppose that 5 of these 12 have defective compressors and the other 7 have less serious problems. If they are examined in random order, let X = the number among the first 6 examined that have a defective compressor. Compute the following:
\begin{parts}
\part[3] $P(X=1)$
\part[3] $P(X \geq 4)$
\end{parts}

\question A reservation service employs five information operators who receive requests for information independently of one another, each according to a Poisson process with rate $\mu=2$ per minute.
\begin{parts}
\part[4] What is the probability that during a given 1-min period, the first operator receives no requests?
\part[4] What is the probability that during a given 1-min period, exactly four of the five operators receive no requests?(\textit{Hint}: treat either as a binomial process of 5 trials with 4 successes or consider 5 combinations of Poisson processes, e.g. only 1st operation receives a request  or only 2nd operation receives a request and so on)
\end{parts}
